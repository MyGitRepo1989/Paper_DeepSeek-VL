<p>Steps to build and implement the hybrid multimodal model:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Step 1: Define High-Resolution Vision Encoder</strong></p>
    <p>Design a convolutional neural network (CNN) to process high-resolution images (e.g., 1024x1024). Use layers like Conv2D, MaxPooling2D, and GlobalAveragePooling2D to extract detailed features and reduce the spatial dimensions effectively.</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p><strong>Step 2: Define Low-Resolution Vision Encoder</strong></p>
    <p>Create another CNN for low-resolution images (e.g., 384x384). This encoder focuses on extracting broader semantic features from images, which complement the high-resolution encoder.</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p><strong>Step 3: Design Vision-Language Adaptor</strong></p>
    <p>Build a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) to bridge the concatenated outputs of the high-resolution and low-resolution encoders into a common embedding space. This module will align visual features with the language model.</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p><strong>Step 4: Incorporate a Language Model</strong></p>
    <p>Integrate a pretrained language model (e.g., transformer-based or LSTM-based) to handle text processing. This model will receive the aligned features from the vision-language adaptor and process text-based reasoning tasks.</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p><strong>Step 5: Fuse Multimodal Outputs</strong></p>
    <p>Combine the outputs from the vision encoders and the language model into a unified representation. Use concatenation or attention-based mechanisms to ensure efficient fusion of the modalities.</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p><strong>Step 6: Add Task-Specific Output Layer</strong></p>
    <p>Add a dense layer for the final output. Use an activation function like softmax for classification tasks or a linear layer for regression tasks, depending on the problem at hand.</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p><strong>Step 7: Compile the Model</strong></p>
    <p>Compile the model using an appropriate optimizer (e.g., Adam) and loss function (e.g., categorical crossentropy for classification). Specify metrics like accuracy for evaluation.</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p><strong>Step 8: Train the Model</strong></p>
    <p>Train the model on multimodal datasets, such as image-text pairs. Start with a small subset for debugging and gradually scale up to larger datasets for better generalization.</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p><strong>Step 9: Evaluate the Model</strong></p>
    <p>Evaluate the model's performance on a separate validation dataset. Monitor metrics like accuracy, loss, or other relevant evaluation criteria depending on the task.</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p><strong>Step 10: Fine-Tune and Optimize</strong></p>
    <p>Fine-tune the model by adjusting hyperparameters, adding regularization, or training on additional datasets to improve performance. Optimize for specific tasks as needed.</p>
  </li>
</ul>



Paper Implementation- DeepSeek-VL: Towards Real-World Vision-Language Understanding
We present DeepSeek-VL, an open-source Vision-Language (VL) Model designed for real-world vision and language understanding applications. Our approach is structured around three key dimensions:

• Data Construction: We strive to ensure our data is diverse, scalable and extensively covers real-world scenarios including web screenshots, PDFs, OCR, charts, and knowledge-based content (expert knowledge, textbooks), aiming for a comprehensive representation of practical contexts. Further, we create a use case taxonomy from real user scenarios and construct an instruction-tuning dataset accordingly. The fine-tuning with this dataset substantially improves the model’s user experience in practical applications.

• Model Architecture: Considering efficiency and the demands of most real-world scenarios, DeepSeek-VL incorporates a hybrid vision encoder that efficiently processes high-resolution images (1024 x 1024) within a fixed token budget, while maintaining a relatively low computational overhead. This design choice ensures the model’s ability to capture critical semantic and detailed information across various visual tasks.

• Training Strategy: We posit that a proficient Vision-Language Model should, foremost, possess strong language abilities. To ensure the preservation of LLM capabilities during pretraining, we investigate an effective VL pretraining strategy by integrating LLM training from the beginning and carefully managing the competitive dynamics observed between vision and language modalities. Starting with a focus on text, we gradually adjust the ratio to facilitate a balanced integration of both modalities.

The DeepSeek-VL family (both 1.3B and 7B models) showcases superior user experiences as a vision-language chatbot in real-world applications, achieving state-of-the-art or competitive performance across a wide range of visual-language benchmarks at the same model size while maintaining robust performance on language-centric benchmarks. We have made both 1.3B and 7B models publicly accessible to foster innovations based on this foundation model.

To approach AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) in a multimodal context using this architecture, we can extend the hybrid multimodal model to integrate and process diverse modalities—such as vision, language, and potentially audio or sensory data—through a shared embedding space. The model employs a hybrid vision encoder for extracting both high-level semantics (low-res) and fine-grained details (hi-res) from visual inputs, while a vision-language adaptor bridges these visual features to a pretrained language model capable of reasoning and generating responses. By incorporating sequential training strategies—such as pretraining on large-scale interleaved datasets and fine-tuning on specific multimodal tasks—the model gains a balanced understanding of both modalities while retaining strong reasoning capabilities. Expanding this architecture with time-series encoders (for videos), reinforcement learning (for real-world interactions), and hierarchical memory modules could enable the system to adaptively reason, learn from context, and interact seamlessly across complex, real-world scenarios—key steps towards AGI.
